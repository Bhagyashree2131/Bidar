<hr/><h2>Gurudwara discription</h2><hr/>
<pre>
The Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwara, dedicated to the Sikh Guru Nanak, is a historical shrine that is situated in Bidar in North Karnataka. This gurudwara is a well known 
one and many devotees visit this place.<br/><br/>
<hr/><h2>Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwaraâ€“ Overview</h2><hr/>

Devotees throng to the Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwara especially during Guru Nanak Jayanti. Volunteers make elaborate preparations to celebrate the Guru Nanak Jayanti, which 
is one of the major festivals of the Sikhs. Preparations include cleaning the gurudwara, guarding the shoes of visitors and helping out in the kitchen. The gurudwara is 
especially adorned with flags, banners and lights for this occasion.

<hr/><h2>HISTORY</h2><hr/>
Guru Nanak, in his second missionary tour, visited South India after touring through Khandwa and Nagpur and finally reached Nanded after visiting the Hindu temple of 
Omkareshwara on the Narmada. The Guru then proceeded towards Golconda and Hyderabad. Here he met Muslim saints and then went to meet Yakoob Ali and Pir Jalaluddin at Bidar.

The Guru was put up at the outskirts of Bidar along with his companion Mardana. The place where the Guru temporarily resided is now the Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwara. 
The sermons and teachings of the Guru during his sojourn at Bidar attracted a lot of followers and soon people came to listen to the Guru to seek his blessings.
<hr/><h2>MYTHOLOGY</h2><hr/>
The people who were residing in Bidar were miserable due to a shortage in water supply in this town. The Guru was moved by their plight and decided to rescue them from their 
miserable condition. He touched the hillside with his toe removing some rubble in the process. A fountain of sweet water flowed out from this hillside and the place was 
rechristened as Nanak Jhira.
